    "text": "2.2 Methodology\nThis project is broken into three main parts. First, we conduct an international analysis of all countries to uncover global trends in humanitarian security incidents. Next, we take a closer look at eight contemporary conflict hotspots—Afghanistan, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Mali, Palestine, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, and Syria—to explore country-specific patterns and challenges. Lastly, throughout our analysis, we encountered a significant number of unknown values; we examine the implications of this missing data and reflect on how uncertainty shapes our understanding of humanitarian risk."

Mali emerges as a major hotspot primarily in the past 15 years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough they represent just 8.4% of the countries in the dataset, these eight countries account for 63.8% of all recorded incidents.\n\n\n\n5,375 humanitarian aid workers have been affected by the violence in these countries."

    "section": "3.2 Key Findings",
    "text": "3.2 Key Findings\n\n3.2.1 Staff Nationality and Casualty Patterns\nThere is a consistent disparity in security incidents affecting national versus international staff:\n\nNational staff account for a significant amount of all casualities (killed, wounded, and kidnapped)\n\nThis pattern represents both an operational challenge and an ethical concern for humanitarian organizations attempting to manage risk equitably.\n\n\n\n\n    Humanitarian Security Incidents by Country\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2.2 Attack Methods, Contexts, and Locations\nAttack methods, contexts, and locations vary significantly across these eight conflict zones, reflecting differences in conflict dynamics, armed actor capabilities, and tactical objectives:\n\n\n\n\n    Top Three Attack Methods, Contexts & Locations by Country\n\n\n    0–49\n    50–99\n    100–149\n    150+\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHumanitarian security threats vary widely, with common attack methods including kidnappings, ambushes, shootings, and exposure to crossfire. These threats often occur during travel or in insecure compounds, highlighting the need for context-specific strategies. Ambushes require secure movement planning, crossfire zones need early warning systems and shelter, and areas prone to kidnappings or compound attacks demand staff training and physical site protection. Road travel remains especially risky, emphasizing the importance of route assessments and convoy protocols to safeguard aid workers.\n\n\n3.2.3 Political Transitions Create Vulnerability Windows\nSecurity incidents consistently spike during power transitions, though the specific relationship varies:\n\nPeace agreements sometimes correlate with increased incidents\nCoups and regime changes usually lead to immediate security deterioration\nTerritorial control shifts create new vulnerability patterns\n\n\n\n\n  Select a country below to learn more about the conflict it has faced.\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      Syria\n    \n  \n  \n  \n    \n      Occupied Palestinian Territories\n    \n  \n  \n  \n    \n      Afghanistan\n    \n  \n  \n  \n    \n      Somalia\n    \n  \n  \n  \n    \n      South Sudan\n    \n  \n  \n  \n    \n      Sudan\n    \n  \n  \n  \n    \n      DR Congo\n    \n  \n  \n  \n    \n      Mali\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n3.2.4 Missing Context, Hidden Risks\nMissing data remains a major challenge. In several countries, over one-third of incidents lack key contextual information—limiting our ability to fully understand patterns of violence and potentially underrepresenting specific threats."

    "text": "4.1 Implications from Key Findings\n\nSecurity strategies must be context-specific\nPatterns of violence vary widely by country—kidnappings, ambushes, aerial bombardments—making one-size-fits-all protocols ineffective.\nNational staff face disproportionate risk\nAcross all regions, national personnel experience 5–10 times more casualties than international staff, raising urgent ethical and operational concerns.\nPolitical transitions increase risk\nSecurity incidents often spike during leadership changes, peace deals, or shifts in territorial control, creating windows of heightened vulnerability.\nLower incident counts don’t always signal improvement\nA decline in reported attacks may reflect aid withdrawal or underreporting, especially in high-unknown-data contexts—not necessarily increased safety.\nData gaps obscure key risks\nIn many countries, over one-third of records lack crucial context, limiting the ability to design fully informed security strategies."

# Executive Summary

# Background: The Conflict

## Historical Context

The conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo represents one of Africa's most complex and enduring crises. Rooted in the aftermath of the 1994 Rwandan Genocide, the violence has evolved through two major regional wars—the First Congo War (1996-1997) and the Second Congo War (1998-2003)—which collectively resulted in millions of deaths. Despite formal peace agreements, eastern DRC has remained unstable, with over 120 different armed groups competing for territory, resources, and influence in the mineral-rich regions of North Kivu, South Kivu, and Ituri provinces.

## Recent Escalation

In early 2025, M23 rebels, backed by Rwandan troops, captured Goma in eastern DRC, killing between 900-2,000 civilians and triggering mass displacement. This represented the culmination of escalating violence that began with M23's resurgence in 2022 and their steady territorial gains throughout 2023. The situation had already deteriorated significantly following DRC's contested December 2023 elections, which sparked nationwide unrest. During 2024, the humanitarian situation worsened dramatically, with 358,000 newly displaced people and a 30% rise in violations against children. The U.S.-brokered peace agreement in late 2023 failed to prevent the conflict's intensification.

# Nature of Security Incidents {#sec-nature}

## Predominant Attack Types

```{python}
#| label: fig-attack-types
#| fig-cap: "Most common types of attacks"
#| echo: false

attack_counts = country_data['means_of_attack'].value_counts().reset_index()
attack_counts.columns = ['Attack Type', 'Count']
attack_counts = attack_counts.sort_values('Count', ascending=False).head(10)

fig_attacks = px.bar(
    attack_counts,
    y='Attack Type',
    x='Count',
    title=None,
    height=500,
    orientation='h'
)

fig_attacks.update_traces(marker_color=palette["primary"])

fig_attacks.update_layout(
    yaxis={'categoryorder': 'total ascending'},
    xaxis_title="Number of Incidents",
    yaxis_title=None
)

fig_attacks.show()
```

### Analysis of Attack Methods

This bar chart reveals that kidnapping and shooting are the predominant attack methods in the DRC conflict. Bodily assault represents the third most common tactic. The high prevalence of kidnappings aligns with documented tactics by armed groups in eastern DRC, particularly by militia groups seeking ransom or using abductions to intimidate local populations and establish territorial control.

## Attack Contexts

```{python}
#| label: fig-attack-contexts
#| fig-cap: "Security incidents by attack context"
#| echo: false

context_counts = country_data['attack_context'].value_counts().reset_index()
context_counts.columns = ['Attack Context', 'Count']

context_counts = context_counts.sort_values('Count', ascending=False)

fig_context = px.bar(
    context_counts,
    x='Attack Context',
    y='Count',
    title=None,
    height=450
)

fig_context.update_traces(marker_color=palette["primary"])

fig_context.update_layout(
    xaxis_title=None,
    yaxis_title="Number of Incidents",
    xaxis={'categoryorder': 'total descending', 'tickangle': 45}
)

fig_context.show()
```

### Analysis of Attack Contexts

The prevalence of ambushes reflects the tactical approach of armed groups operating in the DRC. The high number of ambushes aligns with the geographical characteristics of the conflict zone, where dense forests and limited road infrastructure create ideal conditions for surprise attacks by M23 rebels and other armed groups. The substantial number of unknown contexts points to the challenges in documenting incidents in remote areas with limited monitoring presence.

# Human Impact of Security Incidents {#sec-impact}

## Casualties by Category

```{python}
#| label: fig-casualties
#| fig-cap: "Total casualties by category"
#| echo: false

stacked_data = {
    'Category': ['Nationals', 'Internationals'],
    'Killed': [
        country_data['nationals_killed'].sum(),
        country_data['internationals_killed'].sum()
    ],
    'Wounded': [
        country_data['nationals_wounded'].sum(),
        country_data['internationals_wounded'].sum()
    ],
    'Kidnapped': [
        country_data['nationals_kidnapped'].sum(),
        country_data['internationals_kidnapped'].sum()
    ]
}

stacked_df = pd.DataFrame(stacked_data)
stacked_df_long = pd.melt(
    stacked_df,
    id_vars=['Category'],

    var_name='Status',
    value_name='Count'
)

fig_stacked = px.bar(
    stacked_df_long,
    x='Category',
    y='Count',
    color='Status',
    title=None,
    barmode='stack',
    height=500,
    color_discrete_map={
        'Killed': palette["danger"], 
        'Wounded': palette["primary"], 
        'Kidnapped': palette["secondary"]
    }
)

fig_stacked.update_layout(
    xaxis_title=None,
    yaxis_title="Number of People",
    legend_title_text=None
)

fig_stacked.show()

```

### Analysis of Casualty Patterns

The significantly higher rate of kidnappings among nationals compared to other casualty types reflects a tactical choice by armed groups in eastern DRC, who frequently use abductions to control territory, extract resources, and recruit fighters. This pattern aligns with reports from UN agencies documenting extensive use of kidnapping by the various groups. The disproportionate impact on nationals versus internationals highlights how Congolese civilians bear the overwhelming burden of the conflict. *source*

## Gender Distribution of Affected Individuals

```{python}
#| label: fig-gender
#| fig-cap: "Gender distribution of affected individuals"
#| echo: false

gender_cols = ['gender_male', 'gender_female']
if all(col in country_data.columns for col in gender_cols):
    # Sum up total counts by gender
    gender_totals = {
        'Gender': ['Male', 'Female'],
        'Count': [
            country_data['gender_male'].sum(),
            country_data['gender_female'].sum()
        ]
    }

    gender_df = pd.DataFrame(gender_totals)

    fig_gender = px.bar(
        gender_df,
        x='Gender',
        y='Count',
        title=None,
        height=450
    )

    fig_gender.update_traces(marker_color=palette["primary"])

    fig_gender.update_layout(
        xaxis_title=None,
        yaxis_title="Number of Individuals"
    )

    fig_gender.show()
```

### Analysis of Gender Patterns

The pronounced overrepresentation of males in the casualty data can be attributed to several factors characteristic of the DRC conflict. Men are more frequently recruited or forcibly conscripted into armed groups. Additionally, men are often specifically targeted in attacks based on their perceived potential to join opposing armed groups or resist territorial control.

# Organizations and Actors {#sec-organizations}

## Organizations Affected by Security Incidents

```{python}
#| label: fig-organizations
#| fig-cap: "Security incidents by organization type"
#| echo: false

org_cols = ['un', 'ingo', 'icrc', 'nrcs_and_ifrc', 'nngo', 'other']

org_totals = country_data[org_cols].sum().reset_index()
org_totals.columns = ['Organization Type', 'Total Incidents']

org_labels = {
    'un': 'United Nations',
    'ingo': 'International NGO',
    'icrc': 'Int. Committee of Red Cross',
    'nrcs_and_ifrc': 'National Red Cross/Red Crescent',
    'nngo': 'National NGO',
    'other': 'Other Organizations'
}

org_totals['Organization'] = org_totals['Organization Type'].map(org_labels)

org_totals = org_totals.sort_values('Total Incidents', ascending=False)

fig_orgs = px.bar(
    org_totals,
    y='Organization',
    x='Total Incidents',
    title=None,
    height=500,
    orientation='h'
)

fig_orgs.update_traces(marker_color=palette["primary"])

fig_orgs.update_layout(
    yaxis_title=None,
    xaxis_title="Number of Incidents",
    yaxis={'categoryorder': 'total ascending'}
)

fig_orgs.show()
```

### Analysis of Organizational Impact

International NGOs face the highest security risks in the DRC, far exceeding those experienced by National NGOs and UN entities. This disproportionate targeting reflects their extensive operations in conflict zones, particularly in M23-controlled territories where armed groups deliberately restrict humanitarian access as part of territorial control strategies. *source*

## Comparison of Actor Types

```{python}
#| label: fig-actors
#| fig-cap: "Host State vs Foreign Actors in Security Incidents"
#| echo: false

relevant_actors = ['Host state', 'Foreign or coalition forces']
actor_data = country_data[country_data['actor_type'].isin(relevant_actors)]

if len(actor_data) > 0:
    actor_counts = actor_data['actor_type'].value_counts().reset_index()
    actor_counts.columns = ['Actor Type', 'Count']
    
    fig_actors = px.bar(
        actor_counts,
        x='Actor Type',
        y='Count',
        title=None,
        height=450
    )
    
    fig_actors.update_traces(marker_color=palette["primary"])
    
    fig_actors.update_layout(
        xaxis_title=None,
        yaxis_title="Number of Incidents"
    )
    
    fig_actors.show()
```

### Analysis of Actor Responsibility

The chart shows that all documented incidents occurred within the host state (DRC), but the scale maxing out at only 4 incidents suggests significant data limitations. This unusually low incident count likely indicates substantial gaps in data collection or attribution rather than reflecting the true security situation. Complete incident data from eastern DRC is notoriously difficult to obtain due to access constraints, communication challenges in remote areas, and the nature of the conflict.

# Major Incidents {#sec-major}

## Top 5 Most Impactful Security Incidents

```{python}
#| label: tbl-top-incidents
#| tbl-cap: "Most impactful security incidents (by total affected)"
#| echo: false

if not country_data.empty and 'total_affected' in country_data.columns:
    top5_incidents = country_data.sort_values(by='total_affected', ascending=False).head(5)
    
    display_cols = ['year', 'location', 'total_affected', 'total_killed', 'total_wounded', 'attack_context', 'actor_type']
    column_names = {
        'year': 'Year', 
        'location': 'Location', 
        'total_affected': 'Total Affected',
        'total_killed': 'Killed', 
        'total_wounded': 'Wounded',
        'attack_context': 'Context',
        'actor_type': 'Actor Type'
    }
    
    display_df = top5_incidents[display_cols].rename(columns=column_names)
    display(display_df)
```

### Analysis of Major Incidents

The table reveals a pattern of security incidents in the DRC spanning two decades (1997-2017), with road attacks being most frequent, suggesting the particular vulnerability of transportation routes in the conflict zone, while the deadliest incident occurred during the 1997 First Congo War period with 10 fatalities.

# Conclusions and Recommendations {#sec-conclusions}

## Key Findings

- Security incidents in the DRC follow cyclical patterns tied to political events, with major escalations during M23 rebellions (2012-2013, 2022) and peaking with the capture of Goma in 2025.
- Ambushes are the predominant attack context, while kidnapping and shooting are the most common attack methods, creating significant challenges for movement along transportation corridors.
- Congolese nationals suffer approximately 14 times more casualties than internationals, with males disproportionately represented in casualty data, though gender-based violence is likely underreported.
- International NGOs face the highest security risks, particularly during road travel, which has been the site of multiple significant incidents between 2015-2017.

## Recommendations

### For Security Planning

- Implement comprehensive route risk assessments with regular updates based on local intelligence networks, focusing particularly on roads connecting major population centers to rural areas.
- Develop convoy protocols that incorporate lessons from documented ambush incidents, including appropriate vehicle spacing, communications procedures, and checkpoint management.
- Establish clear thresholds for program suspension and evacuation based on the timing and nature of political developments, given the correlation between events like elections and violence escalation.
- Create specialized security protocols for different operational contexts, recognizing the distinct risk profiles associated with road movement versus fixed locations.

### For Humanitarian Organizations

- Improve information sharing and security coordination between international and national NGOs working in the same areas.
- Build capacity of national organizations to manage security threats, as they often have fewer resources than international counterparts.
- Create backup plans to maintain essential services during high-risk periods, especially during elections or after M23 advances.
- Provide mental health support for all staff, particularly national personnel who cannot easily evacuate during crises.
- Strengthen data collection systems to better document incidents, especially those affecting women and in remote areas, to improve understanding of the full scope of violence.

### For Policy Development

- Advocate for humanitarian access guarantees from all armed groups, with special focus on securing transportation corridors where ambushes are prevalent and establishing neutral zones around humanitarian facilities.

### For Future Research

- Investigate the significant gender disparity in casualty data to determine whether this reflects reporting biases or genuine differences in targeting patterns.

# Executive Summary

# Background: The Conflict

Mali stands at the epicenter of the Sahel's security crisis, with violent extremist organizations expanding their control across the country's northern and central regions. Following the 2021 military coup and subsequent withdrawal of French forces and UN peacekeepers, Mali's security situation has deteriorated dramatically. The military junta's pivot to Russian Wagner Group mercenaries has coincided with increased civilian casualties and human rights abuses, including the Moura massacre where over 300 civilians were killed. Violence has surged, with JNIM gaining territory in northern Mali and blockading Timbuktu, while renewed fighting with Tuareg separatists threatens to reignite civil war. This instability has displaced hundreds of thousands of Malians and threatens to spread to neighboring countries, creating one of Africa's most urgent humanitarian and security crises.

## Historical Context

Mali's crisis began with the 2012 Tuareg rebellion, triggered by fighters and weapons flowing from Libya after Gaddafi's fall. The Tuareg MNLA briefly allied with Islamist groups to capture northern cities and declare the independent Azawad state. A military coup in March 2012 further destabilized Mali, until French intervention in 2013 pushed back the Islamists. Mali transitioned to civilian rule under President Keïta and signed a 2015 peace agreement with Tuareg groups, but excluded Islamists who then expanded into central Mali. Years of marginalization in northern regions, weak governance, and corruption created fertile ground for extremist recruitment among disenfranchised populations.

## Recent Escalation 

Mali's security has deteriorated rapidly since the 2020-2021 military coups. The junta cut ties with France in 2022 and hired Wagner Group mercenaries, coinciding with increased violence including the Moura massacre where over 300 civilians died. In 2023, Mali expelled UN peacekeepers, creating a security vacuum that extremist groups immediately exploited. Attacks have more than doubled since the UN withdrawal began, with JNIM now controlling northern territories and blockading Timbuktu. Simultaneously, fighting has reignited with Tuareg separatists in the northeast. With international support gone and violence surging on multiple fronts, Mali now stands on the brink of civil war.

# Nature of Security Incidents {#sec-nature}

## Predominant Attack Types

```{python}
#| label: fig-attack-types
#| fig-cap: "Most common types of attacks"
#| echo: false

attack_counts = country_data['means_of_attack'].value_counts().reset_index()
attack_counts.columns = ['Attack Type', 'Count']
attack_counts = attack_counts.sort_values('Count', ascending=False).head(10)

fig_attacks = px.bar(
    attack_counts,
    y='Attack Type',
    x='Count',
    title=None,
    height=500,
    orientation='h'
)

fig_attacks.update_traces(marker_color=palette["primary"])

fig_attacks.update_layout(
    yaxis={'categoryorder': 'total ascending'},
    xaxis_title="Number of Incidents",
    yaxis_title=None
)

fig_attacks.show()
```

### Analysis of Attack Methods

The significant disparity between kidnapping and other attack methods highlights how extremist groups have adapted their strategies, focusing on operations that require minimal resources while maximizing psychological impact and financial gain.

## Attack Contexts

```{python}
#| label: fig-attack-contexts
#| fig-cap: "Security incidents by attack context"
#| echo: false

context_counts = country_data['attack_context'].value_counts().reset_index()
context_counts.columns = ['Attack Context', 'Count']

context_counts = context_counts.sort_values('Count', ascending=False)

fig_context = px.bar(
    context_counts,
    x='Attack Context',
    y='Count',
    title=None,
    height=450
)

fig_context.update_traces(marker_color=palette["primary"])

fig_context.update_layout(
    xaxis_title=None,
    yaxis_title="Number of Incidents",
    xaxis={'categoryorder': 'total descending', 'tickangle': 45}
)

fig_context.show()
```

### Analysis of Attack Contexts

There is a significant gap between ambushes and the second most common category. This disparity highlights how armed groups in Mali have strategically prioritized ambush tactics, likely due to their effectiveness along the country's limited road networks. *source*

# Human Impact of Security Incidents {#sec-impact}

## Casualties by Category

```{python}
#| label: fig-casualties
#| fig-cap: "Total casualties by category"
#| echo: false

stacked_data = {
    'Category': ['Nationals', 'Internationals'],
    'Killed': [
        country_data['nationals_killed'].sum(),
        country_data['internationals_killed'].sum()
    ],
    'Wounded': [
        country_data['nationals_wounded'].sum(),
        country_data['internationals_wounded'].sum()
    ],
    'Kidnapped': [
        country_data['nationals_kidnapped'].sum(),
        country_data['internationals_kidnapped'].sum()
    ]
}

stacked_df = pd.DataFrame(stacked_data)
stacked_df_long = pd.melt(
    stacked_df,
    id_vars=['Category'],
    value_vars=['Killed', 'Wounded', 'Kidnapped'],
    var_name='Status',
    value_name='Count'
)

fig_stacked = px.bar(
    stacked_df_long,
    x='Category',
    y='Count',
    color='Status',
    title=None,
    barmode='stack',
    height=500,
    color_discrete_map={
        'Killed': palette["danger"], 
        'Wounded': palette["primary"], 
        'Kidnapped': palette["secondary"]
    }
)

fig_stacked.update_layout(
    xaxis_title=None,
    yaxis_title="Number of People",
    legend_title_text=None
)

fig_stacked.show()
```

### Analysis of Casualty Patterns

This chart shows that Malian nationals suffer far more from conflict than internationals. Kidnapping is the most common form of violence against locals, showing how armed groups target communities to gain control and extract ransoms. This data highlights that Malians themselves bear the overwhelming burden of the country's ongoing security crisis.

## Gender Distribution of Affected Individuals

```{python}
#| label: fig-gender
#| fig-cap: "Gender distribution of affected individuals"
#| echo: false

gender_cols = ['gender_male', 'gender_female']
if all(col in country_data.columns for col in gender_cols):
    gender_totals = {
        'Gender': ['Male', 'Female'],
        'Count': [
            country_data['gender_male'].sum(),
            country_data['gender_female'].sum()
        ]
    }

    gender_df = pd.DataFrame(gender_totals)

    fig_gender = px.bar(
        gender_df,
        x='Gender',
        y='Count',
        title=None,
        height=450
    )

    fig_gender.update_traces(marker_color=palette["primary"])

    fig_gender.update_layout(
        xaxis_title=None,
        yaxis_title="Number of Individuals"
    )

    fig_gender.show()
```

### Analysis of Gender Patterns

This chart shows a significant gender disparity in conflict casualties in Mali, with approximately 115 males affected compared to only about 13 females. The roughly 9:1 male-to-female ratio likely reflects how armed groups specifically target men for recruitment, detention, or elimination as potential security threats.

# Organizations and Actors {#sec-organizations}

## Organizations Affected by Security Incidents

```{python}
#| label: fig-organizations
#| fig-cap: "Security incidents by organization type"
#| echo: false

org_cols = ['un', 'ingo', 'icrc', 'nrcs_and_ifrc', 'nngo', 'other']

org_totals = country_data[org_cols].sum().reset_index()
org_totals.columns = ['Organization Type', 'Total Incidents']

org_labels = {
    'un': 'United Nations',
    'ingo': 'International NGO',
    'icrc': 'Int. Committee of Red Cross',
    'nrcs_and_ifrc': 'National Red Cross/Red Crescent',
    'nngo': 'National NGO',
    'other': 'Other Organizations'
}

org_totals['Organization'] = org_totals['Organization Type'].map(org_labels)

org_totals = org_totals.sort_values('Total Incidents', ascending=False)

fig_orgs = px.bar(
    org_totals,
    y='Organization',
    x='Total Incidents',
    title=None,
    height=500,
    orientation='h'
)

fig_orgs.update_traces(marker_color=palette["primary"])

fig_orgs.update_layout(
    yaxis_title=None,
    xaxis_title="Number of Incidents",
    yaxis={'categoryorder': 'total ascending'}
)

fig_orgs.show()
```

### Analysis of Organizational Impact

This chart shows that International NGOs face the highest number of security incidents in Mali (approximately 150), followed by National NGOs (about 100). United Nations entities experience significantly fewer incidents (around 25), while Red Cross organizations and others report minimal incidents. This pattern reflects the extensive field presence of NGOs in conflict-affected areas where state authority has receded, particularly following the withdrawal of international forces and UN peacekeepers. *source*

## Comparison of Actor Types

```{python}
#| label: fig-actors
#| fig-cap: "Host State vs Foreign Actors in Security Incidents"
#| echo: false

relevant_actors = ['Host state', 'Foreign or coalition forces']
actor_data = country_data[country_data['actor_type'].isin(relevant_actors)]

if len(actor_data) > 0:
    actor_counts = actor_data['actor_type'].value_counts().reset_index()
    actor_counts.columns = ['Actor Type', 'Count']
    
    fig_actors = px.bar(
        actor_counts,
        x='Actor Type',
        y='Count',
        title=None,
        height=450
    )
    
    fig_actors.update_traces(marker_color=palette["primary"])
    
    fig_actors.update_layout(
        xaxis_title=None,
        yaxis_title="Number of Incidents"
    )
    
    fig_actors.show()
```

### Analysis of Actor Responsibility

The chart shows that all documented incidents occurred within the host state (DRC), but the scale maxing out at only 1 incident suggests significant data limitations. This unusually low incident count likely indicates substantial gaps in data collection or attribution rather than reflecting the true security situation. 

# Major Incidents {#sec-major}

## Top 5 Most Impactful Security Incidents

```{python}
#| label: tbl-top-incidents
#| tbl-cap: "Most impactful security incidents (by total affected)"
#| echo: false

if not country_data.empty and 'total_affected' in country_data.columns:
    top5_incidents = country_data.sort_values(by='total_affected', ascending=False).head(5)
    
    display_cols = ['year', 'location', 'total_affected', 'total_killed', 'total_wounded', 'attack_context', 'actor_type']
    column_names = {
        'year': 'Year', 
        'location': 'Location', 
        'total_affected': 'Total Affected',
        'total_killed': 'Killed', 
        'total_wounded': 'Wounded',
        'attack_context': 'Context',
        'actor_type': 'Actor Type'
    }
    
    display_df = top5_incidents[display_cols].rename(columns=column_names)
    display(display_df)
```

### Analysis of Major Incidents

This table displays five significant security incidents in Mali from 2018 to 2024, highlighting the evolution of the conflict. The incidents in public locations (2018) and at project sites (2022) each affected 9 individuals, suggesting targeted attacks on civilian gatherings and humanitarian operations. Road incidents in 2020 and 2024 each affected 6 people.

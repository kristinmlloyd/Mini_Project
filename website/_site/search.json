This distribution offers important insights:\n\nMilitary nature of conflict: The predominance of aerial bombardment suggests a significant role of military forces with air capabilities in the conflict.\nDiversity of threats: Beyond the top two methods, the data shows a range of attack types including shelling, bodily assault, and various forms of explosives.\nCivilian vulnerability: Many of these attack types affect wide areas, putting civilians at significant risk even when not directly targeted."

This finding has important implications:\n\nCollateral impact: Many incidents occur during active combat situations where individuals are caught between opposing forces rather than being directly targeted.\nConflict zone risks: Being in or near active conflict zones represents the greatest security risk in the region.\nSecurity planning: Different contexts require different security approaches - avoiding combat zones entirely may be more effective than other security measures."

However, the scale of the difference is notable and has important implications for civilian protection and humanitarian programming."

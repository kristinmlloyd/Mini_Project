Incidents surge, peaking in 2024 with the SAF counteroffensive and high-profile events like the assassination of the Darfur governor.\n2025: Incident numbers drop significantly following the SAF’s recapture of Khartoum areas, suggesting a potential shift in conflict intensity or a redistribution of control.\n\nThese patterns indicate that spikes in violence are closely tied to leadership changes, territorial contests, and transitions in power, reinforcing the need for real-time monitoring during political turning points."

Kidnapping and bodily assault are also common, reflecting tactics aimed at intimidation and disruption of humanitarian work. A significant portion of incidents are recorded as “unknown,” highlighting data gaps and the opacity of conflict environments. These attack types reflect the dangers posed to aid workers not only from crossfire but also from deliberate targeting."

The prevalence of ambushes indicates high risks associated with road travel, reinforcing the need for dynamic security planning, route risk assessments, and protection protocols, especially for humanitarian convoys."

Nationals face nearly ten times more fatalities than international staff, emphasizing the local toll of the crisis. The high proportion of fatalities relative to injuries also suggests that many attacks are deliberately lethal. This underscores the need for context-specific strategies that prioritize national staff safety and psychological support."

The Tuareg MNLA briefly allied with Islamist groups to capture northern cities and declare the independent Azawad state. A military coup in March 2012 further destabilized Mali, until French intervention in 2013 pushed back the Islamists. Mali transitioned to civilian rule under President Keïta and signed a 2015 peace agreement with Tuareg groups, but excluded Islamists who then expanded into central Mali. Years of marginalization in northern regions, weak governance, and corruption created fertile ground for extremist recruitment among disenfranchised populations."

The junta cut ties with France in 2022 and hired Wagner Group mercenaries, coinciding with increased violence including the Moura massacre where over 300 civilians died. In 2023, Mali expelled UN peacekeepers, creating a security vacuum that extremist groups immediately exploited. Attacks have more than doubled since the UN withdrawal began, with JNIM now controlling northern territories and blockading Timbuktu. Simultaneously, fighting has reignited with Tuareg separatists in the northeast. With international support gone and violence surging on multiple fronts, Mali now stands on the brink of civil war."

Kidnapping is the second most frequent, underscoring the targeting of humanitarian staff for leverage or ransom. A significant number of incidents are marked as unknown, highlighting information gaps in reporting or incident classification.\nWhile bodily assault and IED-related attacks (e.g., vehicle-borne, roadside, and body-borne) are less frequent, their presence indicates a diversity of tactics used by non-state actors, especially Al-Shabaab. The low frequency of complex and suicide-style bombings may reflect either underreporting or a tactical shift away from high-profile mass-casualty attacks in recent years.\nThis distribution emphasizes the need for operational awareness in areas prone to small-arms fire and a heightened focus on abduction prevention and response."

Individual attacks rank closely behind, suggesting targeted incidents against specific staff or facilities rather than broad confrontations.\nThe relatively high number of unknown contexts suggests a need for improved field reporting and classification. Raids and combat/crossfire represent organized or opportunistic engagements, while mob violence and detention appear far less frequently but may reflect localized tensions or government involvement.\nThis pattern reinforces the operational necessity of route planning, protective protocols for national staff, and scenario-specific security training that prepares personnel for both ambush-style and individualized threats."

However, the scale of the difference is notable and has important implications:\n\nProtection needs: The disproportionate impact on locals highlights the critical need for civilian protection measures that extend beyond international personnel.\nHumanitarian considerations: The high casualty rates among Afghan nationals underscore the humanitarian dimension of the conflict, beyond the security of aid workers.\nRisk differentials: The relatively lower casualties among internationals may reflect differences in exposure, protection measures, or targeting patterns."

This reflects their greater exposure to conflict zones and frontline operations compared to international staff, who typically work in more secure or urban environments.\nThe high number of national fatalities suggests that many incidents are either highly lethal or occur in areas with limited access to emergency care. In contrast, international casualties remain minimal, likely due to stronger protection protocols, lower deployment in high-risk zones, and more rapid evacuation options.\nThese disparities highlight the urgent need for equitable duty-of-care policies and enhanced security measures for national staff, who remain the backbone of humanitarian efforts in Syria’s most dangerous regions."

This decline likely reflects reduced humanitarian presence rather than genuine security improvements, as it coincides with increased intercommunal violence and restricted access.\n\nThis pattern illustrates how formal political agreements in South Sudan have often failed to translate into improved security for humanitarian operations, with peaks in incidents paradoxically occurring during supposed “peace” periods, while recent declines may mask deteriorating conditions and shrinking humanitarian space."

This aligns with the earlier analysis showing ambushes as the most frequent attack method. The sample shows multiple significant incidents in 2018, which aligns with the period following the signing of the Revitalized Peace Agreement. This suggests that despite political agreements at the national level, security incidents continued to threaten civilians and aid operations on the ground.\nFor more detailed information on the South Sudan conflict timeline, see the Council on Foreign Relations Conflict Tracker."

    "text": "7.1 Key Findings\nThis analysis of security incidents in South Sudan reveals several critical patterns with important operational implications:\n\nPolitical agreements don’t ensure security: Formal peace deals have repeatedly failed to improve humanitarian security, with incident levels paradoxically reaching their highest points after peace agreement signings.\nProfessional military tactics dominate: The prevalence of shootings and ambushes indicates coordinated operations by trained fighters rather than random violence, suggesting systematic targeting of humanitarian operations.\nInfrastructure limitations increase vulnerability: Limited road networks funnel humanitarian movements through predictable routes, enabling effective ambush operations by armed groups.\nNational staff bear highest risk: While all humanitarian workers face significant danger, South Sudanese nationals experience casualty rates over ten times higher than international staff.\nAccess constraints mask security deterioration: The recent decline in incidents appears to reflect restricted humanitarian access rather than improved security conditions, as overall violence continues to intensify."

This data may underrepresent violence against women, particularly sexual violence, is often underreported in conflict zones due to stigma and limited access to reporting mechanisms.\n\n\n\n9.1.3 Implications for Protection\n\nTraining should address the specific needs and vulnerabilities of different gender groups\n\nUnderstanding these gender dimensions helps organizations develop more effective and inclusive security strategies that protect all personnel regardless of gender."

Rooted in the aftermath of the 1994 Rwandan Genocide, the violence has evolved through two major regional wars—the First Congo War (1996-1997) and the Second Congo War (1998-2003)—which collectively resulted in millions of deaths. Despite formal peace agreements, eastern DRC has remained unstable, with over 120 different armed groups competing for territory, resources, and influence in the mineral-rich regions of North Kivu, South Kivu, and Ituri provinces."

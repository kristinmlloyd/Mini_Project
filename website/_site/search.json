    "text": "2.1 Historical Context\nSudan faces a catastrophic humanitarian crisis as civil war between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and Rapid Support Forces (RSF) enters its third year. Since April 2023, approximately 150,000 people have died and 14 million been displaced. Three million refugees have fled to neighboring countries, while 30 million need humanitarian assistance. The UN warns Sudan faces the “world’s largest hunger crisis.”\nThe conflict stems from a power struggle between SAF leader Burhan and RSF commander Hemedti after they jointly overthrew dictator Bashir in 2019. Foreign involvement has complicated peace efforts. Recently, SAF has gained territory around Khartoum, while RSF continues committing atrocities in Darfur, raising concerns of renewed genocide (Foreign Relations 2024)."

This reflects their greater exposure on the ground, often serving in front-line or field-based roles where risks are highest.\nWhile international staff are affected, their casualty numbers remain comparatively low—likely due to stricter security protocols, evacuation mechanisms, and lower operational presence in high-risk zones.\nThe high number of fatalities among nationals is particularly concerning and underscores the urgent need for protective measures, trauma support, and equitable duty-of-care standards regardless of staff nationality."

Syria leads in data completeness, yet nearly one-fifth of gender records remain undocumented.\nEmergency Response Priorities: During humanitarian crises, responders often prioritize basic needs (e.g., food, water, shelter) over detailed demographic tracking.\nReporting Biases: Incidents affecting females may be underreported in some settings. This data may underrepresent violence against women, particularly sexual violence, is often underreported in conflict zones due to stigma and limited access to reporting mechanisms.\nLegal and Social Norms: In some countries, recognition of non-binary or transgender individuals is limited or criminalized, leading to exclusion or misclassification. This can result in either lumping into “unknown” or not recording the data at all.\n\nRecommendations \n\nBased on these findings, we recommend the following approaches:\n\nAcknowledge data limitations: All security analysis using such data should explicitly discuss information gaps and their potential impact on findings. Reports should include data completeness metrics as standard context.\nDevelop missingness-aware methods: Statistical approaches that account for systematic patterns in missing data should be employed when comparing across countries or analyzing perpetrator trends. This might include:\n\nMissingness indicators as covariates in statistical models\nMultiple imputation techniques for sensitivity analysis\nWeighted analysis that gives less weight to countries with more incomplete data\n\nContextual interpretation: Findings should be interpreted in light of local reporting constraints, with input from field-based experts who understand documentation challenges. This local expertise can help contextualize whether “Unknown” values result from security constraints, resource limitations, or other factors.\nInvestment in documentation: Humanitarian organizations should prioritize strengthening incident reporting systems, particularly for perpetrator identification, while maintaining reporter safety. This could include:\n\nDeveloping standardized reporting protocols\nTraining local staff in documentation practices\nCreating secure, anonymous reporting channels\nImplementing retrospective data enhancement processes\n\nTargeted improvements: Focus documentation improvement efforts on Sudan, DR Congo, and Afghanistan, where information gaps are most severe. These countries would benefit most from enhanced reporting infrastructure and methodology.\nPattern analysis of unknowns: Rather than treating “Unknown” values as simply missing, analyze their patterns and correlations to gain insights about the conditions under which information gaps occur. This meta-analysis can reveal important contextual factors affecting documentation.\nTransparency in derived conclusions: When publishing analysis based on this data, clearly communicate the limitations and acknowledge how missing data may affect conclusions. This transparency builds credibility and encourages appropriate use of the findings.\n\nBy implementing these recommendations, organizations can both improve the quality of security incident data and make more responsible use of existing information, despite its limitations.RetryClaude can make mistakes.

This decline likely reflects reduced humanitarian presence rather than genuine security improvements, as it coincides with increased intercommunal violence and restricted access.\n\nThis pattern illustrates how formal political agreements in South Sudan have often failed to translate into improved security for humanitarian operations, with peaks in incidents paradoxically occurring during supposed “peace” periods, while recent declines may mask deteriorating conditions and shrinking humanitarian space."

This aligns with the earlier analysis showing ambushes as the most frequent attack method. The sample shows multiple significant incidents in 2018, which aligns with the period following the signing of the Revitalized Peace Agreement. This suggests that despite political agreements at the national level, security incidents continued to threaten civilians and aid operations on the ground.\nFor more detailed information on the South Sudan conflict timeline, see the Council on Foreign Relations Conflict Tracker."

The high number of ambushes aligns with the geographical characteristics of the conflict zone, where dense forests and limited road infrastructure create ideal conditions for surprise attacks by M23 rebels and other armed groups. The substantial number of unknown contexts points to the challenges in documenting incidents in remote areas with limited monitoring presence."

This pattern aligns with reports from UN agencies documenting extensive use of kidnapping by the various groups. The disproportionate impact on nationals versus internationals highlights how Congolese civilians bear the overwhelming burden of the conflict. source"

    "text": "7.1 Key Findings\nThis analysis of security incidents in the Democratic Republic of Congo reveals several critical patterns and trends:\n\nPolitical transitions impact security: Major surges in security incidents coincided with political transitions, notably after Tshisekedi took power in 2019, suggesting internal instability during power shifts.\nKidnapping as primary tactic: Unlike other conflict zones, the DRC shows a distinct pattern of kidnappings as the predominant means of attack, reflecting armed groups’ strategic priorities for funding and control.\nAmbush as primary context: Most security incidents occur during ambushes, highlighting the tactical approach of armed groups exploiting the region’s challenging geography and infrastructure limitations.\nDisproportionate impact on nationals: Congolese nationals face significantly higher risks of kidnapping compared to internationals, underscoring the unequal exposure to security threats.\nGeographic vulnerabilities: Road networks and transportation routes emerge as particularly high-risk areas, with the majority of major incidents occurring during movement.\n\n\nRecommendations \n\nThese findings suggest specific approaches for operating in the DRC context:\n\n7.1.1 For Security Planning\n\nImplement comprehensive journey management protocols with real-time risk assessments\nEstablish robust communication networks with regular check-in procedures during movements\nDevelop specific anti-kidnapping protocols and train staff on prevention and response\nConsider armed escorts on high-risk routes where appropriate and legally permissible\nEstablish clear security thresholds that trigger operational suspensions\n\n\n\n7.1.2 For Humanitarian Organizations\n\nBalance operational presence with a thorough understanding of conflict dynamics in each area\nInvest in community acceptance strategies by engaging with local leaders and communities\nConsider remote programming models in areas with highest kidnapping risks\nPrioritize national staff security with equal investment in protection measures\nDevelop context-specific security training focusing on ambush prevention and response\n\n\n\n7.1.3 For Policy Development\n\nAdvocate for protected humanitarian corridors in high-risk areas\nSupport enhanced coordination mechanisms for security information sharing\nEngage with donors on realistic security costs in project budgets\nDevelop systematic approaches to engaging with armed groups for humanitarian access\nPromote accountability for attacks against humanitarian workers\n\n\n\n7.1.4 For Future Research\n\nInvestigate the relationship between mineral resource extraction and security incidents\nAnalyze the effectiveness of different security approaches in reducing kidnapping risks\nExamine the long-term trends in security following major political transitions\nStudy the impact of UN peacekeeping presence on humanitarian security incident patterns\nResearch community-based protection mechanisms that have proven effective in the DRC context"

This finding has important implications:\n\nCollateral impact: Many incidents occur during active combat situations where individuals are caught between opposing forces rather than being directly targeted.\nConflict zone risks: Being in or near active conflict zones represents the greatest security risk in the region.\nSecurity planning: Different contexts require different security approaches - avoiding combat zones entirely may be more effective than other security measures.\n\nThe significant number of “Individual attack” incidents (second most common) also suggests that targeted violence remains a notable security concern, requiring different mitigation strategies."

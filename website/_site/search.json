    "text": "2.1 Historical Context\nMali’s crisis began with the 2012 Tuareg rebellion, triggered by fighters and weapons flowing from Libya after Gaddafi’s fall. The Tuareg MNLA briefly allied with Islamist groups to capture northern cities and declare the independent Azawad state. A military coup in March 2012 further destabilized Mali, until French intervention in 2013 pushed back the Islamists. Mali transitioned to civilian rule under President Keïta and signed a 2015 peace agreement with Tuareg groups, but excluded Islamists who then expanded into central Mali. Years of marginalization in northern regions, weak governance, and corruption created fertile ground for extremist recruitment among disenfranchised populations."

The junta cut ties with France in 2022 and hired Wagner Group mercenaries, coinciding with increased violence including the Moura massacre where over 300 civilians died. In 2023, Mali expelled UN peacekeepers, creating a security vacuum that extremist groups immediately exploited. Attacks have more than doubled since the UN withdrawal began, with JNIM now controlling northern territories and blockading Timbuktu. Simultaneously, fighting has reignited with Tuareg separatists in the northeast. With international support gone and violence surging on multiple fronts, Mali now stands on the brink of civil war."

    "text": "2.1 Historical Context\nSudan gained independence in 1956, but divisions between the wealthier north and less-developed south led to decades of conflict. Following two civil wars, South Sudan gained independence in 2011 after 99 percent voted for separation. The new state quickly descended into turmoil as weak governance and ethnic tensions erupted. In December 2013, conflict broke out when President Kiir accused Vice President Machar of plotting a coup and removed him from office. Violence spread between the Dinka (aligned with Kiir) and Nuer (supporting Machar) ethnic groups.\nThe conflict resulted in approximately 400,000 deaths and displaced four million people. Armed groups targeted civilians along ethnic lines, committed sexual violence, and recruited child soldiers. After several failed peace attempts, Kiir and Machar signed a revitalized peace agreement in 2018, establishing a unity government in 2020."

The country also experienced the beginning of a fiscal crisis when fighting in neighboring Sudan damaged a critical oil pipeline, cutting nearly two-thirds of state revenue.\nViolence has significantly intensified since early 2025. Clashes between government forces (SSPDF) and opposition forces (SPLA/IO) began in January and escalated in February with fighting in Upper Nile state. On March 4, militia forces overran an army base in Nasir, leading to the arrest of opposition leaders and Machar being placed under house arrest. A failed UN extraction attempt on March 7 resulted in the death of a prominent general and dozens of soldiers. Ugandan troops have reportedly deployed to protect President Kiir.\nThe situation is compounded by a fiscal crisis that began when fighting in Sudan damaged a critical oil pipeline in 2024, cutting two-thirds of state revenue. Over 7.7 million people face severe food insecurity—the worst in the country’s history—with flooding since May 2024 threatening millions more. The postponement of elections to 2026 and growing tensions raise concerns of further violence, while fighting from Sudan threatens to spill over into South Sudan’s territory."

Rooted in the aftermath of the 1994 Rwandan Genocide, the violence has evolved through two major regional wars—the First Congo War (1996-1997) and the Second Congo War (1998-2003)—which collectively resulted in millions of deaths. Despite formal peace agreements, eastern DRC has remained unstable, with over 120 different armed groups competing for territory, resources, and influence in the mineral-rich regions of North Kivu, South Kivu, and Ituri provinces."

Complete incident data from eastern DRC is notoriously difficult to obtain due to access constraints, communication challenges in remote areas, and the nature of the conflict."

# Executive Summary

![](images/af2.png){width=200px}

# Background: The Conflict

## Historical Context

Afghanistan has experienced over four decades of continuous conflict since the Soviet invasion in 1979. Following the Soviet withdrawal in 1989, the country descended into civil war, eventually leading to Taliban rule from 1996 to 2001. After the September 11, 2001 attacks, a US-led coalition overthrew the Taliban regime, establishing the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan. The subsequent two decades saw ongoing insurgency, with the Taliban gradually regaining control of territory despite the presence of international forces [@cfr_afghanistan]. Key developments included:

-   **2001-2014**: NATO-led International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) mission
-   **2014-2021**: NATO Resolute Support Mission focused on training Afghan forces
-   **2020**: US-Taliban peace agreement signed in Doha, Qatar
-   **August 2021**: Taliban takeover following US and NATO withdrawal

## Recent Escalation

Following the Taliban's return to power in August 2021, Afghanistan has faced multiple interconnected crises:

-   Approximately 28 million people requiring humanitarian assistance
-   Political transformation under Taliban governance
-   Economic collapse and banking sector crisis
-   Severe humanitarian emergency affecting most of the population
-   Increasing security threats from ISIS-Khorasan (ISIS-K)
-   Natural disasters including earthquakes and drought
-   International isolation and sanctions affecting aid delivery

These factors have created a challenging operational environment for humanitarian organizations, with significant implications for security risk management.

### Analysis of Incident Trends

The line chart reveals a distinctive pattern in security incidents in Afghanistan:

-   **Initial low levels (1996-2002)**: Following Taliban rule and early in the US invasion, security incidents affecting humanitarian workers remained relatively low.

-   **Steady increase (2003-2009)**: A gradual rise in incidents coincided with expanding insurgency operations and the US troop surge, reflecting deteriorating security conditions.

-   **Peak period (2010-2014)**: Incident levels reached their highest point during the later years of NATO combat operations, with a dramatic spike in 2013 representing the most dangerous period for humanitarian operations.

-   **Sharp decline (2015-2016)**: Following the transition to the NATO Resolute Support Mission and reduced international military footprint, incidents declined significantly.

-   **Fluctuating lower levels (2017-2025)**: Despite periodic increases, incidents have generally remained lower than during the peak conflict years, with a continued downward trend following the Taliban's return to power in 2021.

This pattern suggests that humanitarian security incidents were paradoxically more frequent during periods of intensive international military operations than during Taliban governance, challenging conventional assumptions about operational security risk factors in Afghanistan.

## Predominant Attack Types

```{python}
#| label: fig-attack-types
#| fig-cap: "Most common types of attacks"
#| echo: false

attack_counts = country_data['means_of_attack'].value_counts().reset_index()
attack_counts.columns = ['Attack Type', 'Count']
attack_counts = attack_counts.sort_values('Count', ascending=False).head(10)

fig_attacks = px.bar(
    attack_counts,
    y='Attack Type',
    x='Count',
    title=None,
    height=500,
    orientation='h'
)

fig_attacks.update_traces(marker_color=palette["primary"])

fig_attacks.update_layout(
    yaxis={'categoryorder': 'total ascending'},
    xaxis_title="Number of Incidents",
    yaxis_title=None
)

fig_attacks.show()
```

### Analysis of Attack Methods

1. **Kidnapping dominance**: The high frequency of kidnapping incidents reflects Afghanistan's complex security environment where abductions serve multiple purposes - from financial gain through ransoms to political leverage. This creates significant risks for both international and local personnel.

2. **Armed violence**: Shooting incidents represent the second most frequent attack type, indicating the widespread availability of firearms and their regular use in security incidents. This aligns with Afghanistan's history of armed conflict and the proliferation of weapons.

3. **IED threat**: Both vehicle-borne and roadside IEDs appear in the mid-range of attack methods, representing a significant but not dominant threat. These sophisticated attack methods typically indicate organized armed group activity.

## Attack Contexts

```{python}
#| label: fig-attack-contexts
#| fig-cap: "Security incidents by attack context"
#| echo: false

context_counts = country_data['attack_context'].value_counts().reset_index()
context_counts.columns = ['Attack Context', 'Count']

context_counts = context_counts.sort_values('Count', ascending=False)

fig_context = px.bar(
    context_counts,
    x='Attack Context',
    y='Count',
    title=None,
    height=450
)

fig_context.update_traces(marker_color=palette["primary"])

fig_context.update_layout(
    xaxis_title=None,
    yaxis_title="Number of Incidents",
    xaxis={'categoryorder': 'total descending', 'tickangle': 45}
)

fig_context.show()
```

### Analysis of Attack Contexts

Key Findings:

- Combat/crossfire represents a significant proportion of incidents, indicating the ongoing active conflict environment
- Direct targeted attacks account for many incidents, showing deliberate targeting rather than collateral impact
- Ambushes feature prominently, highlighting risks along travel routes and during movements
- Raids on facilities demonstrate vulnerabilities of fixed installations and compounds

## Casualties by Category

```{python}
#| label: fig-casualties
#| fig-cap: "Total casualties by category"
#| echo: false

stacked_data = {
    'Category': ['Nationals', 'Internationals'],
    'Killed': [
        country_data['nationals_killed'].sum(),
        country_data['internationals_killed'].sum()
    ],
    'Wounded': [
        country_data['nationals_wounded'].sum(),
        country_data['internationals_wounded'].sum()
    ],
    'Kidnapped': [
        country_data['nationals_kidnapped'].sum(),
        country_data['internationals_kidnapped'].sum()
    ]
}

stacked_df = pd.DataFrame(stacked_data)
stacked_df_long = pd.melt(
    stacked_df,
    id_vars=['Category'],
    value_vars=['Killed', 'Wounded', 'Kidnapped'],
    var_name='Status',
    value_name='Count'
)

fig_stacked = px.bar(
    stacked_df_long,
    x='Category',
    y='Count',
    color='Status',
    title=None,
    barmode='stack',
    height=500,
    color_discrete_map={
        'Killed': palette["danger"], 
        'Wounded': palette["primary"], 
        'Kidnapped': palette["secondary"]
    }
)

fig_stacked.update_layout(
    xaxis_title=None,
    yaxis_title="Number of People",
    legend_title_text=None
)

fig_stacked.show()
```

### Analysis of Casualty Patterns

The stacked bar chart reveals a stark disparity in how security incidents affect different population groups in Afghanistan:

- Afghan nationals have suffered significantly higher casualties across all categories, with roughly 440 killed, 350 wounded, and 430 kidnapped
- International personnel have experienced far fewer casualties, approximately 90 total across all categories
- The ratio of nationals to internationals affected is about 10:1

This pattern is not unusual in conflict zones, where local populations typically bear the brunt of violence. However, the scale of the difference is notable and has important implications:

1. **Protection needs**: The disproportionate impact on locals highlights the critical need for civilian protection measures that extend beyond international personnel.

2. **Humanitarian considerations**: The high casualty rates among Afghan nationals underscore the humanitarian dimension of the conflict, beyond the security of aid workers.

3. **Risk differentials**: The relatively lower casualties among internationals may reflect differences in exposure, protection measures, or targeting patterns.

## Top 5 Most Impactful Security Incidents

```{python}
#| label: tbl-top-incidents
#| tbl-cap: "Most impactful security incidents (by total affected)"
#| echo: false

if not country_data.empty and 'total_affected' in country_data.columns:
    top5_incidents = country_data.sort_values(by='total_affected', ascending=False).head(5)
    
    display_cols = ['year', 'location', 'total_affected', 'total_killed', 'total_wounded', 'attack_context', 'actor_type']
    column_names = {
        'year': 'Year',

    }
    
    display_df = top5_incidents[display_cols].rename(columns=column_names)
    display(display_df)
```

### Analysis of Major Incidents

The table above highlights the five most impactful security incidents in Afghanistan based on the total number of people affected. These high-casualty events reveal several important patterns:

-   The most severe incident occurred in 2015 at a project site, resulting in 49 casualties (14 killed and 35 wounded), indicating the vulnerability of development projects in Afghanistan
-   Office/compound locations feature prominently in the data, appearing twice in the top five incidents (in 2021 and 2009), suggesting that fixed facilities remain high-value targets
-   Road incidents also pose significant risks, as shown by the 2009 incident with 16 affected individuals, likely representing a kidnapping event given the absence of killed or wounded
-   The incidents span from 2009 to 2021, demonstrating that high-impact security events have been a persistent feature of the Afghan security landscape across different phases of the conflict
-   Three of the five incidents resulted in fatalities, while two incidents (both with 12 affected individuals) show no deaths or injuries, suggesting these were likely kidnapping incidents

These high-impact events, while relatively rare, account for a disproportionate share of total casualties.

# Conclusions and Recommendations {#sec-conclusions}

## Key Findings

This analysis of security incidents in Afghanistan reveals several critical patterns and trends:

1.  **Changing patterns over time**: Security incidents peaked during intensive NATO operations (2010-2014) and have generally declined since, with further reduction following Taliban control in 2021.

2.  **Targeted attacks predominate**: Unlike Palestine's collateral damage pattern, Afghanistan shows more deliberate targeting of humanitarian operations, particularly compounds and convoys.

3.  **High-impact events**: Major incidents at fixed locations account for a disproportionate share of casualties, highlighting the vulnerability of permanent facilities.

4.  **Kidnapping dynamics**: Afghanistan shows a distinctive pattern of kidnapping incidents, particularly along roads and transport routes.

## Recommendations

These findings suggest specific approaches for operating in the Afghan context:

### For Security Planning

-   Implement robust physical security measures for compounds and offices
-   Develop comprehensive convoy security protocols with route risk assessments
-   Maintain low-profile operations in high-risk areas
-   Establish clear kidnapping prevention and response procedures

### For Humanitarian Organizations

-   Balance operational effectiveness with security considerations when determining fixed vs. mobile programming
-   Invest in local acceptance strategies, especially given the changing political landscape
-   Develop contingency plans for periods of heightened risk

### For Policy Development

-   Support coordinated security information sharing platforms among humanitarian actors
-   Advocate for humanitarian access in high-risk areas through diplomatic channels
-   Encourage donor flexibility regarding security costs in project budgets

### For Future Research

-   Examine the relationship between political transitions and security incident patterns
-   Investigate the effectiveness of different security approaches in the post-2021 context
-   Compare security incidents affecting humanitarian versus development actors

By providing a data-driven understanding of security patterns in Afghanistan, this analysis aims to contribute to safer and more effective operations in this challenging environment.

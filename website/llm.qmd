# ðŸ¤– LLM Use Log

Throughout this project, I used a large language model (LLM) as a collaborative tool to support various aspects of my analysis and presentation. Specifically:

- I used the LLM to reword and refine my own ideas, helping me express complex concepts more clearly while maintaining the original intent and tone.
- LLM's assisted me in interpreting timelines and summarizing key events drawn from conflict tracker websites. This was particularly helpful when organizing country-specific narratives and understanding overlapping crises.
- I also leveraged the LLM to brainstorm and debug advanced interactive visualizations, especially those involving animation, filtering, and custom styling. While the model provided guidance, I actively engaged in the coding process and deepened my understanding of the tools and techniques involved.

Overall, the LLM served as a learning companion, offering support without replacing the analytical or creative thinking that went into the work.

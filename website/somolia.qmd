# Executive Summary

![](images/somolia.png){width=200px}

This report analyzes humanitarian security incidents in Somalia, one of the most dangerous operational environments for aid workers due to sustained conflict and environmental shocks.

Key findings include:

- **Non-state armed groups—especially Al-Shabaab—drive most attacks**, with violence intensifying during military offensives and territorial shifts.
- **Incident frequency peaked during key flashpoints**, including Al-Shabaab’s rise (2008), cross-border activity, and the 2022 “total war” campaign.
- **Shooting and kidnapping are the most common attack methods**, often targeting humanitarian staff directly.
- **Ambushes dominate the attack context**, particularly along roads, making mobility a major operational hazard.
- **National staff bear the greatest burden**, accounting for the majority of those killed, wounded, and kidnapped.
- **High-impact incidents cluster around roads and office compounds**, emphasizing the need for context-specific and mobile security measures.

These patterns call for data-driven planning, localized security strategies, and stronger policy frameworks to reduce risk and maintain humanitarian access in Somalia.

# Background: The Conflict

## Historical Context

The Somali conflict has been shaped by decades of state collapse, civil war, and the rise of extremist groups. Al-Shabaab emerged from this chaotic environment, tracing its origins to Afghan war veterans who returned to Somalia in the late 1980s [@cfr_somalia]. The group's evolution occurred against a backdrop of complete state failure:

-   **1991**: Collapse of the Somali central government, leading to prolonged civil war
-   **Late 1990s**: Formation of al-Ittihad al-Islami (AIAI), a Salafi militant organization
-   **2004-2006**: Rise of the Islamic Courts Union (ICU) controlling much of southern Somalia
-   **2006**: Ethiopian invasion to oust ICU from Mogadishu, triggering al-Shabaab's formal establishment
-   **2007**: Creation of African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) peacekeeping force
-   **2010-2011**: Al-Shabaab reaches peak territorial control, including parts of Mogadishu
-   **2012**: Establishment of Federal Government of Somalia (FGS), beginning efforts to rebuild state institutions
-   **2013-2021**: Al-Shabaab demonstrates resilience despite territorial losses, launching high-profile attacks across East Africa

## Recent Escalation

Somalia entered a new phase in its fight against al-Shabaab in 2022, with intensified military operations and evolving humanitarian challenges:

-   **May 2022**: Hassan Sheikh Mohamud elected president, promising renewed focus on defeating al-Shabaab
-   **August 2022**: Launch of "total war" against al-Shabaab, a major government offensive supported by clan militias
-   **April 2022**: AMISOM replaced by African Union Transition Mission in Somalia (ATMIS) with planned withdrawal by end of 2024
-   **2022**: 41% increase in al-Shabaab violence targeting civilians despite territorial losses
-   **2021-2023**: Five consecutive failed rainy seasons produced Somalia's worst drought on record
-   **October 2023**: Devastating floods affecting 2.48 million people after years of drought
-   **37%** of the population requiring humanitarian assistance
-   **3.8 million** internally displaced persons
-   **4.3 million** people facing crisis or worse levels of food insecurity

### Analysis of Incident Trends

The timeline of humanitarian security incidents in Somalia reflects the cyclical intensity of conflict linked to Al-Shabaab’s activity:

- **2006–2008:** A sharp spike in incidents corresponds to **Ethiopia’s invasion** and **Al-Shabaab’s rise**, culminating in their peak territorial control by 2008.
- **2011–2013:** After the **creation of AMISOM** and major **Mogadishu truck bombings**, violence fluctuates but remains high.
- **2017–2020:** A period of relative stabilization is followed by renewed violence after **declared "total war" against Al-Shabaab**.
- **2023:** A final spike appears to be driven more by **climate-related emergencies**, including **devastating floods**, complicating the humanitarian environment further.

This pattern shows how armed group dynamics, regional interventions, and environmental crises all contribute to fluctuations in humanitarian risk across time.

# Nature of Security Incidents {#sec-nature}

## Predominant Attack Types

```{python}
#| label: fig-attack-types
#| fig-cap: "Most common types of attacks"
#| echo: false

attack_counts = country_data['means_of_attack'].value_counts().reset_index()
attack_counts.columns = ['Attack Type', 'Count']
attack_counts = attack_counts.sort_values('Count', ascending=False).head(10)

fig_attacks = px.bar(
    attack_counts,
    y='Attack Type',
    x='Count',
    title=None,
    height=500,
    orientation='h'
)

fig_attacks.update_traces(marker_color=palette["primary"])

fig_attacks.update_layout(
    yaxis={'categoryorder': 'total ascending'},
    xaxis_title="Number of Incidents",
    yaxis_title=None
)

fig_attacks.show()
```

### Analysis of Attack Methods

Shooting is by far the most common method of attack, reflecting the dominance of small-arms conflict in Somalia’s security environment. **Kidnapping** is the second most frequent, underscoring the targeting of humanitarian staff for leverage or ransom. A significant number of incidents are marked as **unknown**, highlighting information gaps in reporting or incident classification.

While **bodily assault** and **IED-related attacks** (e.g., vehicle-borne, roadside, and body-borne) are less frequent, their presence indicates a diversity of tactics used by non-state actors, especially Al-Shabaab. The low frequency of **complex** and **suicide-style bombings** may reflect either underreporting or a tactical shift away from high-profile mass-casualty attacks in recent years.

This distribution emphasizes the need for operational awareness in areas prone to small-arms fire and a heightened focus on abduction prevention and response.

## Attack Contexts

```{python}
#| label: fig-attack-contexts
#| fig-cap: "Security incidents by attack context"
#| echo: false

context_counts = country_data['attack_context'].value_counts().reset_index()
context_counts.columns = ['Attack Context', 'Count']

context_counts = context_counts.sort_values('Count', ascending=False)

fig_context = px.bar(
    context_counts,
    x='Attack Context',
    y='Count',
    title=None,
    height=450
)

fig_context.update_traces(marker_color=palette["primary"])

fig_context.update_layout(
    xaxis_title=None,
    yaxis_title="Number of Incidents",
    xaxis={'categoryorder': 'total descending', 'tickangle': 45}
)

fig_context.show()
```

### Analysis of Attack Contexts

**Ambushes** are the most frequent attack context, indicating a high level of premeditated violence, especially along transit routes and during routine movements. **Individual attacks** rank closely behind, suggesting targeted incidents against specific staff or facilities rather than broad confrontations.

The relatively high number of **unknown** contexts suggests a need for improved field reporting and classification. **Raids** and **combat/crossfire** represent organized or opportunistic engagements, while **mob violence** and **detention** appear far less frequently but may reflect localized tensions or government involvement.

This pattern reinforces the operational necessity of route planning, protective protocols for national staff, and scenario-specific security training that prepares personnel for both ambush-style and individualized threats.

## Location of Attack

```{python}
#| label: fig-attack-locations
#| fig-cap: "Most common attack locations"
#| echo: false

# Get top 10 most frequent locations
location_counts = country_data['location'].value_counts().reset_index()
location_counts.columns = ['Location', 'Count']
location_counts = location_counts.sort_values('Count', ascending=False).head(10)

# Create bar chart
fig_locations = px.bar(
    location_counts,
    y='Location',
    x='Count',
    title=None,
    height=500,
    orientation='h'
)

fig_locations.update_traces(marker_color="#FFBD59")  # <- updated color

fig_locations.update_layout(
    yaxis={'categoryorder': 'total ascending'},
    xaxis_title="Number of Incidents",
    yaxis_title=None
)

fig_locations.show()
```

### Analysis of Attack Locations

Most humanitarian incidents occurred on roads and in public locations, with a notable portion lacking location details.

### Analysis of Casualty Patterns

The data reveals a stark disparity in impact: **national staff account for the vast majority of casualties**, including deaths, injuries, and kidnappings. This reflects their greater exposure on the ground, often serving in front-line or field-based roles where risks are highest.

While **international staff** are affected, their casualty numbers remain comparatively low—likely due to stricter security protocols, evacuation mechanisms, and lower operational presence in high-risk zones.

The high number of **fatalities among nationals** is particularly concerning and underscores the urgent need for protective measures, trauma support, and equitable duty-of-care standards regardless of staff nationality.

    display(display_df)
```

### Analysis of Major Incidents

The most impactful security incidents in Somalia span over two decades, highlighting the enduring nature of risk across different periods and settings:

- The **deadliest incident**, in 2022, involved an ambush on a road that killed all 14 people affected—illustrating the extreme lethality of roadside attacks.
- A **2017 raid** at a public location resulted in 18 total casualties, the highest overall toll, with a large number wounded.
- Other major incidents occurred at **office compounds** and on **roads**, reaffirming that both operational facilities and transportation routes remain highly vulnerable.
- All top incidents involved **non-state armed groups**, underscoring their persistent threat across time.
- The recurrence of **raids and ambushes** in high-impact events reflects the dominance of tactical surprise and mobility in attack methods.

These findings reinforce the need for proactive security protocols, especially for field sites and ground travel routes.

# Conclusions and Recommendations {#sec-conclusions}

## Key Findings

- **Incident surges reflect major conflict milestones**, with peaks during Al-Shabaab’s territorial expansion and retaliatory attacks after foreign interventions.
- **Shooting and kidnapping dominate attack methods**, pointing to both militarized violence and targeted abduction strategies.
- **Ambushes are the most common context**, especially along roads, posing high risks to mobile teams and convoys.
- **National staff face the highest risks**, accounting for the overwhelming majority of deaths, injuries, and kidnappings.
- **Top-impact incidents occur in roads and compounds**, showing that both movement and fixed locations carry high security exposure.
- **Non-state armed groups are responsible for all major attacks**, indicating persistent insecurity even during periods of relative political calm.

<h2>Recommendations <img src="images/light.png" width="60px" style="vertical-align:middle; margin-left:10px;"></h2>

### For Security Planning

- Routinely map ambush-prone roadways and update movement protocols for affected corridors.
- Reinforce compound perimeters and conduct regular drills for shelter-in-place or raid response.
- Establish early-warning systems tied to Al-Shabaab activity, especially before declared offensives or rainy seasons.

### For Humanitarian Organizations

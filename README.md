# Security Incidents Analysis: Global Patterns and Trends

## 🔍 Overview

This project analyzes global violence against humanitarian aid workers using data from the [Aid Worker Security Database (AWSD)](https://aidworkersecurity.org). It explores **patterns across time, geography, and conflict context**, highlighting both universal trends and country-specific threats. Key features of the dataset include:

- **Temporal and geographic data**: Incident date, location, coordinates  
- **Organizational details**: Nationality of affected staff  
- **Incident specifics**: Attack type, context, and location  
- **Impact metrics**: Numbers killed, wounded, or kidnapped  

The AWSD is widely used by researchers, policy makers, and humanitarian organizations for assessing operational risk.

## 🎯 Research Questions

This analysis is guided by four core questions:

1. What types of attacks are most common?  
2. How does violence vary by year and major political events?  
3. How does risk differ for national vs. international staff?  
4. What contextual factors shape humanitarian security patterns?

## 🛠️ Methodology

The project unfolds in three stages:

1. **Global Analysis**: A broad overview of humanitarian security incidents across all countries.  
2. **Regional Focus**: Deep dives into eight high-risk countries: Afghanistan, DR Congo, Mali, Palestine, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, and Syria.  
3. **Missing Data Analysis**: A critical examination of "Unknown" entries and what they imply for data quality and interpretation.

## 🌍 Regional Focus: Why These Countries?

These eight countries represent just 8.4% of the dataset but account for 63.8% of all recorded security incidents. The selection is based on both historical data and recent trends in conflict and instability.  

Over **5,375 aid workers** have been affected by violence in these countries, underscoring the urgent need for targeted risk analysis.

## 📊 Key Insights

- **National staff** face significantly more risk than international staff across all regions.  
- **Kidnapping, ambushes, and shootings** are among the most common attack methods.  
- **Road travel** continues to be one of the most dangerous operational contexts.  
- **Political transitions**—including coups and peace agreements—often coincide with spikes in violence.  
- **High rates of unknown data** obscure critical context in many countries, especially those with deteriorating security or low reporting capacity.

## 🔒 Recommendations

For humanitarian organizations:

- Develop **context-specific security strategies** tailored to dominant threats (e.g., ambushes vs. aerial attacks).  
- Ensure **equity in protection** between national and international staff.  
- Monitor **political transitions and territorial changes** to anticipate windows of increased risk.  
- Improve **reporting and data completeness** to support better risk modeling.

## 🤖 Use of AI

Large language models (LLMs) were used to support this project by:

- Rewording and refining written content  
- Summarizing conflict timelines from global trackers  
- Assisting with code for advanced interactive visualizations  

The LLM was used as a learning partner—offering suggestions while I built the final logic and outputs independently.
